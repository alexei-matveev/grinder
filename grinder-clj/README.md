## The Grinder: Clojure Leiningen Project

A Clojure library designed to handle grinder build, class path, and
uberjar build.

## Usage

   lein run Console
   lein run Grinder

Console needs to be able to listen to a few
[ports](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/console-service.html) which
may be problematic on Windows in corporate networks.
