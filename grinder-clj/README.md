## Clojure & Leiningen Wrapper

Leiningen project to handle The Grinder build, class path, and
uberjar build. Will hopefully remain a thin wrapper.

See also a [Mavenized
Grinder](https://github.com/gradeawarrior/mavenized-grinder).

## Usage

    lein run Console [-headless]
    lein run Grinder

The Clojure code merely invokes Java classes, either
[Console](../grinder-core/src/main/java/net/grinder/Console.java) or
[Grinder](../grinder-core/src/main/java/net/grinder/Grinder.java).

Console needs to be able to listen to a few ports. The Console listens
by default to 0.0.0.0:6372, this is where the agents will need to
[connect
to](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/getting-started.html). At :6373
there is a REST endpoint of the [Console
service](http://grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/console-service.html) which
is, BTW, also a Clojue [subproject](../grinder-console-service).

### Choosing Grinder UI

By default the Grinder Console starts the Swing UI.

On a headless Linux VM `lein run Console` shows exception saying
DISPLAY is not set while `lein -jar ${uber}.jar Console` appears to
start the console (rest) service as if one specified `-headless`
option. Same behaviour is observed if you launch the
[class](../grinder-core/src/main/java/net/grinder/Console.java)
directly:

    java -classpath ${uber}.jar net.grinder.Console

On the other hand if you start it like this:

    java -classpath $(lein classpath) net.grinder.Console

or like this

    java -classpath $(lein classpath) grinder_clj.core Console

The Console would (try to) launch the Swing UI.  There is some
non-trivial logic of
[ConsoleFoundation](../grinder-core/src/main/java/net/grinder/console/ConsoleFoundation.java)
that "dynamically" loads UI versions and if nothing works falls back
to TextUI.

This logic appears to consult the class name in the Java resource
named:

    META-INF/net.grinder.console

and use that as the UI implementation. There appear to be at least two
implementations:

    net.grinder.console.swingui.ConsoleUI
    net.grinder.console.service.Bootstrap

listed respectively in two identically named resource files:

    ../grinder-swing-console/src/main/resources/META-INF/net.grinder.console
    ../grinder-console-service/resources/META-INF/net.grinder.console

The uberjar,  on the other hand,  will only contain one  resource file
named  like  that. It  happens  to  be the  Bootstrap  implementation,
possibly  unfinished.  If  you  edit the  uberjar  with vim  replacing
Bootstrap implementation with  the Swing UI, then  running the uberjar
as above does launch the Swing  UI.  To make that deterministic we put
a third identically named resource into

    ./resources/META-INF/net.grinder.console

choosing the Swing UI option.
