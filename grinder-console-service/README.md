## The Web Console and REST Endpoints

This Clojure/Leiningen project  appears to offer a  few REST endpoints
and a web console as an alternative to the Swing GUI.

## Usage

The web console and rest endpoints are eventually started together
with the Grinder Console, see e.g. the discussion in the [wrapper
project](../grinder-clj/README.md).

For Emacs/Cider you could choose to navigate to

    src/net/grinder/console/service/play.clj

and trigger start/stop of the Grinder Console from there.
